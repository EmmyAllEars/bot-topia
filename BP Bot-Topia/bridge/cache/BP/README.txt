If mob greifing is off the bots cannot plant crops, pick up weapons, etc.\r\n\r\n#Bot-Topia\r\n\r\nWelcome! Bot-Topia is an addon that allows you to build bots, craft parts and add them to your bot. \r\nYou can even craft Bot Chips to program your bots to do jobs for you. This guide will help you with all your bot needs. \r\nThis is my first addon and is a work in progress. Check MCPEDL.com for updates. Enjoy!                  \r\n\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo make things easy all the recipes in this addon can be made using the Bot Crafter and it's the starting point for this addon. \r\nThe order of the recipes are also an indication of the progression in the bot building process. So to get started open up a crafting bench \r\nand throw 1 crafting bench and 1 redstone dust in it to craft one.\r\n\r\nYou can place the Bot Crafter just like any other block in the game. But the easiest way to pick it up is sneak clicking on it. \r\nIt should pop right off the ground for you. It's pretty easy from here but I'll walk you through how to build and use the bots in the next steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n# First Bot\r\n\r\nOnce you craft your first bot you can place it down. You will need to feed it redstone to turn it on. Once it is turned on it will \r\nfollow you if you hold redstone dust or redstone flakes in your hand. You can now access the bots inventory to place things in or take things out.\r\nIf you want your bot to do a task you will need to program it by giving it the appropriate chip.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Farm Bot\r\n\r\nGive your bot a Farm Chip and it will be ready to farm for you. Just take it to your crop of choice and place the seed or crop in\r\nthe bots inventory to get things started.\r\nThis Bot can farm:\r\nwheat\r\npotato\r\ncarrot\r\nbeetroot\r\npumpkin\r\nmelon\r\n\r\n\r\n# Harvest Bot\r\n\r\nHarvest bots will search for farmland to patrol and wait for Farm Bots to load them up with crops. From time to time the Harvest bot will search \r\nfor a hopper in the ground it can sit on to unload its cargo. Remember these bots can't jump so set an item hopper into the ground so they \r\ncan roll on top of it. From there just point the hopper into your storage of choice. Give a Harvest Chip to a bot to make a Harvest Bot.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Hopper Bot\r\n\r\nA Hopper Bot will pick up anything that crosses its path. They move around searching for items to pick up and from time to time they will look\r\nfor a hopper to sit on and unload it's contents. Give a Hopper Chip to a bot to make a Hopper Bot. These guys run around like idiot babies. \r\nMake sure to close off their area. They pick up everything... If something comes up missing check their pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     NEW     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n# Guard Bot\r\n\r\nGuard bots will follow players even if they are not holding redstone or redstone flakes. If you want a Guard Bot to stop following you sneak click on \r\nthe guard bot to make it sit. The Guard bot will hold it's ground. Guard Bots will attack any nearby enemies, or any mob that attacks them or the player.\r\nGuard Bots will also target any mob that you attack. You can drop weapons on the ground and the Guard Bot will pick them up and equip it.  \r\nYou can give it a sword or a bow. They will upgrade the weapon they are holding if a better one is available for them to pick up.\r\nThis also works for armor, you just cant see the armor they are wearing.\r\nYou can ride Guard Bots into battle no saddle needed. You can control the Guard Bots direction by holding a bow in your hand. \r\nWhile riding a Guard bot you can access its inventory. Give a Guard Chip to a Walker Bot to make a Guard bot.\r\n\r\n# All bots\r\nYou can access all of the bots inventories.\r\nOnly the player that programed the bot can access the inventory.\r\nThese bots are not waterproof water and rain will damage them.   *except walker bot for now\r\nYou can pick them up off the ground easily by crouching then clicking on the bot.\r\nThey are attracted to the player holding redstone.\r\nAll bots can be leashed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# special thanks to\r\n\r\nTangoTek\r\ninspired by tektopia\r\n\r\nSolvedDev\r\nhttps://github.com/solvedDev\r\n\r\nBridge\r\nhttps://github.com/bridge-core/bridge\r\n\r\nAdditional sound effects from https://www.zapsplat.com\r\n\r\n\r\n#Change Log 1.0.5\r\nhopper bot is now interested in more items\r\nhopper bot is now a little more interested in items on the ground\r\nremoved some leftover unused code\r\n\r\n\r\n#Change Log 1.0.4\r\n\r\n*added miner bot\r\n\r\n\r\n# Change Log 1.0.2\r\n\r\n9/24/20\r\n\r\n* fixed pick up mechanics for bot and bot crafter\r\n*updated texture for when bot is off\r\n\r\n\r\n9/26/202\r\n\r\n*bots can now be healed by feeding them redstone dust.
